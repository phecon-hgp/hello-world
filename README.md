My hello-world repository. Yay!

You're on the city's tavern, enjoying your first night there before your meeting with the king in the next morning. You have finally brought the evidence that you did not kill his father on the spring festival. You were close on the deadline, but you did it.

Fortunately Alistair managed to be appointed king despite his brother's claims that he would be unfit for duty even being the oldest son. Alistair knew you well enough to not condemn you right away, much different than his devious brother, who, everyone knew, would have put a bounty on your head the moment you left the castle. All he could do now was to hope Alistair would die without heirs.

Suddenly, a man burst into the tavern, gasping, and shouted:
"The king is dead!"

Silence befell the place. Slowly, all eyes turned to you and hands approached and unsheathed more blades than the owner allowed inside the estabilishment. You only had time for one thought:

"Oh, shit..."

Roll initiative!
